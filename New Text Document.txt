I'm a self taught software developer with a long standing passionate for tech.
As a kid and teen, I had your typical story of being curious, taking things apart, 
and along with the tinkering, I eventually explored interests in programming.
So after the odd coding class in high school for visual basic, some years later I 
pursued certifications in web development, design, as well as an algorithm and 
data-structure cert in JavaScript. Ive recently taught myself GML(GameMaker Lang) and am
exploring my creative options in that.

I consider myself a creative and am quite eager to put my skills to use, and my greatest 
aspiration, is to create something that will inspire the cycle of curiosity to begin anew.
